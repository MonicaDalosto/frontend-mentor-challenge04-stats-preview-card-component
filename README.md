## My process

- I started on the Html file, adding the semantic elements;
- I had imported the fonts and created some variables to identify the font-family and the colors;
- I tried to style the elements on CSS using classes instead of the html elements, so I chose the properly class names;
- The project is mobile first (screen: 375px);
- I had used Flexbox to position the elements on the screen, before I started the stylization;
- Then I styled the elements from the top to the bottom;
- Add the responsiveness to the desktop screens (1440px);

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile First

### What I learned

- I've practiced how to create and use the variables in CSS and the flexbox tools
- I've practiced how to code using the mobile first concept

### Continued development

- Practice more the flexbox tools
- Practice and learn the mobile first concepts
- Learn how to code Utility Firts CSS;
